## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I developed this without frameworks or any libraries. Learned a bit of some cool tech with media queries although most of what I did to make this simple website I had done previously years ago. Was refreshing a bit to built this static way like the old days!
